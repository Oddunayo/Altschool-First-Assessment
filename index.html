            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the base:</strong> Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Fry sliced onions until soft and translucent.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook tomato mixture:</strong> Add tomato paste and fry for 3–5 minutes, then add the blended tomato + pepper mixture. Simmer for 10–15 minutes until it reduces and the oil separates from the tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Season:</strong> Stir in thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning — the sauce should be well seasoned because rice absorbs flavour.</li>
            <li><strong>Add rice & stock:</strong> Pour in the rinsed rice and stir to coat every grain with the sauce. Add hot stock just to cover the rice (about 2–3 cups) — do not overfill. Bring to a gentle boil.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer & steam:</strong> Reduce heat to low, cover the pot tightly and cook for 20–30 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed. For a smoky flavour, briefly <mark>blast</mark> the bottom with high heat for 1–2 minutes (watch carefully) or use the traditional "smoke-in" method with foil and a charcoal piece.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Gently fluff the rice with a fork, fold in cooked mixed vegetables and protein, then allow to rest 5 minutes off heat before serving.</li>
            <li><em>Serve hot</em> with fried plantains, salad, or your favourite stew.</li>

         <h2>Tips:</h2>
         <div>
             <ul>
              <li><strong>Rice type:</strong> Parboiled long-grain rice gives the best texture; adjust liquid if using fresh long-grain rice.</li>
              <li><em>Smoky flavour:</em> To get the authentic smoky taste, briefly char a piece of charcoal, put it in a small bowl, place inside the pot on top of the rice, drizzle a teaspoon of oil on the coal and cover immediately — remove the coal after 3–4 minutes.</li>
              <li>Use a tight-fitting lid to prevent steam loss. If your pot leaks steam, reduce heat and check more often.</li>
              <li>Leftovers reheat well; add a splash of water and cover while reheating to revive moisture.</li>
              </ul>
